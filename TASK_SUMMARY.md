# Kids Story Magic App

I have built a magical story app for kids! 

## Features Implemented

- **Dynamic Illustrations**: 
  - Includes a pre-generated story "The Brave Little Rabbit" with custom assets.
  - Includes a dynamic story "Captain Whiskers in Space" that uses **AI generation** (via Pollinations) to create new images on the fly!
- **Magic Wand**: A button to instantly regenerate images for dynamic stories.

## How to Use
The app is already running! Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
